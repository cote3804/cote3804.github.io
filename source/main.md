### Electrochemical Engineering Guided by Simulation

I leverage electronic structure theory to understand the mechanisms that underpin the macroscopic performance of electrocatalytic materials. By understanding mechanisms, I can accelerate the design of active materials used in electrochemical applications.
Beyond first principles, I also apply advanced deep learning techniques that leverage pretrained chemical "foundation" models to encode computable representations into chemical structures. I use these architectures to predict macroscopic observables of liquid electrolytes from chemical fomulation alone and discover the patterns that exist in the interactions between electrolyte molecules.
I have recently begun a postdoctoral position in the Furst Lab at MIT, where I have stretched myself to do experimental research, with the goal of directly measuring the predictions of my models.
I aim to apply my simulation skillsets with my nascent experimental expertise to design materials and unit operations to electriy hard-to-decarbonize sections of heavy industry.
