### Matching catalysts with reactions through simulation

I use grand-canonical density functional theory to simulate 
the electrified interface between catalyst and electrolyte. My simulations have shown
previously unknown potential dependence of fundamental catalytic phenomena that, across material
spaces, have significant impacts on electrocatalyst design. The data generated throughout my PhD is 
and accompanied by an user interface that facilitates data exploration.</p>
I seek generalizable chemical knoweldge that can be used to design catalysts for arbitray
reactions. By smartly restricting chemical space and leveraging massively parallel workflows,
I can quickly downselect material spaces to a few promising candidates. My goal is to match
catalysts with reactions by identfiying kinetic bottlenecks that can be manipulated with
smart catalyst design.
