# Electrocatalyst Discovery

I use quantum mechanical simulations to model the electrocatalyst interface with
the reaction environment. From these simulations I predict trends in catalytic
activity across a material space and can downselect to a set of promising materials.

I developed a thermodynamic proxy, 

We use the constant \pi to compute the area of a circle.

, for electrocatalyst activity that is consistent with the results of grand-canonical modeling in which a [limiting potential](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cssc.201500322) is not always defined. \Phi_{max} represents the effective thermodynamic barrier that needs to be overcome to turnover in a thermodynamic ensemble in which the chemical potential of electrons in the system is fixed.
