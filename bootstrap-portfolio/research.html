        I combine electrochemical physics simulations with thermodynamic proxies of catalyst
        activity to screen broad material spaces for active catalysts. Typical electrochemical studies
        are done using the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model, in which the number of electrons
        transferred in a step is assumed a-priori and must be coupled to simulataneous proton transfers. Following
        the definition of the standard hydrogen electrode, one can set the chemical potential of a proton-electron pair equal to
        one half that of a hydrogen atom. <br> <br>
        \( G_{H^+} + G_{e^-} = -\frac{1}{2} G_{H_2} \) <br> <br>
        The free energy of the proton is potential-independent and the potential dependence of the electron is 
        given by the potential with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).<br> <br>
        \( G_{e^-} = G_{e^-}^0 - U_{SHE}\) <br> <br>
        This then allows one to estimate the 
        <a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cssc.201500322">Limiting Potential \(U_{L}\)</a>
        at which an electrochemical step becomes favorable by dividing the free energy change of that step by the number
        of electrons transferred <br><br>
        \( U_{L} = -\frac{\Delta G_{step}}{N_{e}} \) <br> <br>
        This approach has been widely successful in predicting electrocatalyst activity across a variety of reactions.
        <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp047349j">[1]</a>
        <a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cssc.201500322">[2]</a>
        <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1.1856988">[3]</a> <br> <br>

        However, the CHE model cannot handle non proton-coupled electron transfer steps and enforces an integer number 
        of electrons transferred in each step. For many reactions, there is significant evidence of fractional electron
        transfers as well as electron transfers that do not involve proton transfers. 
        <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.2c01832">[4]</a>
        To capture these phenomena, it is necessary to simulate the system at fixed electron potential and allow the number
        of electrons to self-consistently vary. I perform these simulations using Grand Canonical DFT (GC-DFT), which allows me to 
        study systems under true fixed potentials. <br> <br>

        Using GC-DFT takes away the easy interpretability of \(U_{L}\) and requires a different catalyst activity
        descriptor that has no formal potential dependence. I developed \( \Phi_{max} \), a thermodynamic approximation
        of the 
        <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ar1000956">energetic span</a>, which measures the largest barrier in a
        cyclic catalytic cycle. I used this descriptor to re-evaluate the typical CHE volcano plots for the electrochemical nitrogen
        reduction reaction to understand how explicit inclusion of potential changes catalyst scaling relations.

        <div class="h3 text-light">Electrocatalyst Screening</div>
        Using the scaling relations developed above, I screened a material space for promising nitrogen reduction catalysts.
        This space consisted of binary metal-covalent alloys that combined p-block dopants with transition metals. We found that
        even the most active catalysts in our dataset did not surpass the the activity of the most active metal catalysts because these 
        covalent alloy materials fail to favorably break scaling relations.        
        <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aenm.202304559">[6]</a>
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, we found that traditional electronic structure descriptors like d-band and p-band centers were unable to 
        predict trends in binding energy across the dataset. We believe this is due to the highly geometry-dependent change in the renormalized
        adsorbate frontier orbital energies, which lead to substantially different degrees of bonding for materials with similar d-band centers.
        To correctly precict trends in binding energy across complex material spaces, it is necessary to incorporate the geometry of the surface.

        I have recently begun working with 
        <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/ban/">Chunmei Ban</a>
        on optimizing experimental electrolyte composition for Na-ion batteries. I lead the effort to develop a Bayesian optimization framework
        that uses a gaussian process to estimate the charge capacity at a given cycle based on the mass weights of electrolyte components.

        Re-evaluated nitrogen reduction reaction scaling relations using GC-DFT and the \( \Phi_{max} \) activity descriptor. Unlike
        previous scaling relations, there is a flat peak shaving off the top of the volcano due to the chemical desoption of \( NH_3 \) that is less sensitive
        to the applied potential than the left and right scaling lines, which are comprised of explicit electron transfer steps. These volcanos indicate that 
        tuning the activity of catalysts near the peak of the volcano at modest potentials necessitates selective destabilization of the \( NH_3^* \) state.

      Select materials from the binary covalent alloy screening study. We found that the most active surfaces in our dataset tended
      to have less occupied d-orbitals that were capable of strongly reducing the \( N_2 \) triple bond. However, all materials were
      inevitably limited by the desorption of \( NH_3* \) from the surface. <br> <br>
